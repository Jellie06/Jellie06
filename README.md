**Introduction**

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jellie06. I'm a British developer from England who has a passion for learning and creating ideas.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web devolpment and developing software to help use technology in the way I want to, as well as trying to remove as many difficulties I face using technology with my disability. I'm a massive nerd, so many of my project ideas are about movies, video games and productivity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- ðŸ“– When did I start coding? I've dabbled in various languages since I was about 11 but that usually didn't last long. I started coding more ambitiously about a week ago (as of typing) on 7/7/2022.

**Goals**

- ðŸ“… What are my goals for the year? To obtain decent proficiency in HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as complete some projects.
